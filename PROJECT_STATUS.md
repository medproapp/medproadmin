   - Product templates system
   - Advanced metadata validation
   - Price history tracking

2. **Analytics Dashboard**

   - API documentation (Swagger)
   - Webhook retry mechanism

### Long-term Vision (Quarter 1)
1. **Multi-tenant Support**
   - Separate product catalogs per tenant
   - Tenant-specific pricing
   - Custom branding options

2. **Advanced Features**
   - A/B testing for pricing
   - Subscription lifecycle management
   - Revenue reporting
   - Customer portal integration

3. **Platform Expansion**
   - Mobile app support
   - Public API for partners
   - Marketplace functionality

## ðŸ“š Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights

1. **MySQL Strict Mode Compatibility**
   - GROUP BY requires all non-aggregated columns to be listed
   - LIMIT/OFFSET parameters don't work with prepared statements
   - Solution: Use string interpolation for pagination

2. **Response Wrapping Pitfall**
   - `authenticatedFetch` was double-wrapping responses
   - Backend already returned `{success: true, data: {...}}`
   - Solution: Check if response has success property before wrapping

3. **Database Column Naming**
   - Mismatch between expected and actual column names caused sync failures
   - Always verify schema before writing queries
   - Use DESCRIBE TABLE to confirm structure

4. **Frontend State Management**
   - Vanilla JS requires careful state management
   - Component-based architecture helps maintainability
   - Global instances (window.productAPI) simplify access

### Development Best Practices

1. **Incremental Development**
   - Start with mock data, then integrate real APIs
   - Test each component in isolation
   - Add logging early for easier debugging

2. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error logging is essential
   - User-friendly error messages improve UX
   - Graceful fallbacks prevent complete failures

3. **Documentation**
   - Inline comments for complex logic
   - README files for each major component
   - API endpoint documentation

4. **Security Considerations**
   - JWT tokens for stateless auth
   - Input validation on all endpoints
   - SQL injection prevention with parameterized queries
   - XSS prevention with proper escaping
   - CSP compliance by avoiding inline event handlers

5. **Recent Fixes & Improvements**
   - Fixed CSP violations by replacing all inline onclick handlers with event delegation
   - Ensured proper initialization order for JavaScript components
   - Added null checks to prevent runtime errors
   - Made app instance globally accessible before component initialization

## ðŸ”§ Technical Debt & Improvements

1. **Code Organization**
   - Consider TypeScript for better type safety
   - Implement a build process (webpack/rollup)
   - Add ESLint and Prettier

2. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for API endpoints
   - Integration tests for Stripe sync
   - Frontend component tests
   - E2E tests with Cypress

3. **Performance**
   - Implement caching for product data
   - Optimize database queries
   - Add pagination to frontend
   - Lazy load images

4. **Monitoring**
   - Set up error tracking (Sentry)
   - Add performance monitoring
   - Implement health checks
   - Create alerting system

## ðŸ“Š Current Statistics

- **Products in Database:** 65
- **Prices Configured:** 83
